# Hello World!

This is the first project to be used just to make you confortable with the `git` revision control system and with the `github.com` classroom environment.

The assignment consists just in cloning this repository on your computer, editing this `README.md` file and adding your name as the contributor of this file.

In order to do this you have to use the following commands:

### Cloning the repository on your computer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FWAPP-UniUD/hello-world-<your name>.git
````

The precise git repository can be obtained from the “Clone or download” green button in the github page.

This command will create a directory named `hello-world-<your name>` in the same directory on which you are issuing your command.
    
### Editing the `README.md` file

Use the editor of your choice (the suggested one is Visual Studio Code) for editing the file and adding yourself at the end of the list of contributors below.

### Committing the edited file

Inside the `hello-world-<your name>` directory (`cd` there if needed), you can issue the command:

```bash
git commit -a
```

This will open the editor chosen when you install `git` for entering a commit message describing which are the modifications you did at the project.

### Pushing the commit to the repository

`git` is a distributed version control system, therefore your modifications are not available to other team members working on the same repository unless you *push* them. To this aim you can issue the following command:

```bash
git push
```

### Everything fine?

Remember to add your name in the list of contributors below, to have a sensible change of this file that you can check.

If everything went good, now at `https://github.com/FWAPP-UniUD/hello-world-<your name>` you should see the `README.md` file updated with the new content.
